Debug only one of my sites in a multisite network

== Description ==

I needed to debug only one of my sites in a multisite network so I was not allowed to use WP_DEBUG.

So, I implemented the changes that WP_DEBUG does but only for the website it is installed.

== Installation ==

Upload and activate it. Debug messages will start.

= Uninstall =

To stop showing debug messages, you only need to deactivate this plugin.
